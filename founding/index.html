FOR ACADEMIA
While researchers are most welcome to present their work at EHSM, please
note that this is not a traditional academic conference. We will not
formally publish proceedings(*), and we do not claim affiliation with
any institution. We are also OK with previously published work, we
simply expect quality presentations. The main goals of EHSM are to share
knowledge, learn about new fields, and meet like-minded people - not to
increase one's h-index or anything like that.

<div>
(*) Contrary to the practice of most academic publishers, we will,
however, do our best to ensure the free dissemination of information.
